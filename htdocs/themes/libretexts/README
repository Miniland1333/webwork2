This folder contains the files necessary for the which started as a clone of the math4  theme.  These files are
tracked by git and any changes made to them will be overwritten when you 
upgrade.  The two exceptions are libretexts-overrides.css and libretexts-overrides.js.  

These files do not need to be present, but if they are they will be included 
in system.conf and will override the libretexts.css and libretexts.js theme.  They can 
created by copying libretexts-overrides.css.dist and libretexts-overrides.js.dist.  This 
is similar to how localOverrides.conf interacts with defaults.conf and 
localOverrides.conf.dist.  In particular if you upgrade your server
libretexts-overrides.js and libretexts-overrides.css  will not change, but their .dist 
versions and the other math4 theme files may change. This might cause problems 
until you merge the changes. 

If you want to customize libretexts you should only change libretexts-overrides.css and
libretexts-overrides.js.  Note: Because you can include arbitrary jQuery in 
ilbretexts-overrides.js you can actually change pretty much anything, including 
adding new html or changing existing html.
